## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE

**The warning still appears because you're using Google's test keys.**

This is NORMAL and EXPECTED for development!

### To Remove the Warning:

1. **Get Production Keys:**
   - Visit: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
   - Choose "reCAPTCHA v2" → "I'm not a robot" Checkbox
   - Add domains: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, your production domain
   - Copy both keys

2. **Update .env File:**
   ```bash
   RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_new_site_key_here
   RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_new_secret_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart Server:**
   ```bash
   cd recaptcha-service
   npm start
   ```

4. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
